I am a grad student in the Research Educational Methodology program in the School of Education at the University of Colorado.  My studies, research and other work focus on student measurements (test scores) and their use in various educational policies.  Professionally I am a statistical gun for hire (independent contractor), but I work almost exclusively for the National Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessment.  Specifically, I work with states that use the "Student Growth Percentiles" model as part of the school (and teacher) accountability framework.</p>

				        My experiences are almost exclusively in the use of statistical methods in the social sciences (with a brief foray into health sciences / otology).  I have extensive experience with "big data" from working with statewide educational data.  I am a big believer in communicating statistical results with visualizations and graphics.

						  I am well versed in R, the open source statistical language.  I am author and co-author of several R packages.  I have also recently begun developing websites (such as this one) using various web programming languages, including html, css and javascript.  I am particularly interested in the D3, crossfire, and geo/topoJson javascript libraries.  I use Github extensively and exclusively for all my development projects and websites.

						  I have extensive experience with parallel processing applications, including cluster computing (MPI and Socket) and Hadoop (Map/Reduce).  I typically use the Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 platform, but also have used the Janus Supercomputer at the University of Colorado for cluster computing applications.  I have also dabbled in GPU computing.  I use Linux/Unix alike environments for all my high performance computing applications.
