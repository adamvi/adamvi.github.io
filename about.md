  - label: Applied Statistics and Data Analysis
    description: My experiences are almost exclusively in the use of statistical methods in the social sciences (with a brief foray into health sciences / otology).  I have extensive experience with "big data" from working with statewide educational data.  I am a big believer in communicating statistical results with visualizations and graphics.

# Greetings!
Hello, madam I'm Adam, a doctoral candidate in the Research Educational Methodology program in the School of Education at the University of Colorado and an independent consultant (statistics and high performance computing).  My studies, research and other work focus on student measurements (test scores) and their use in various educational policies.  Professionally I am an independent contractor, but I work almost exclusively for the National Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessment working with states that use the "Student Growth Percentiles" model as part of the school (and teacher) accountability framework.
